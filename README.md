# Hey, I'm Ore 👋

I'm a student getting started with software development, focused on building mobile apps with Flutter.

## Tech Stack

I work with **Dart** and **Flutter**, and I've been getting hands-on with Riverpod, Drift (SQLite), and Firebase.

## Projects I've Built

### [Stash](https://github.com/oreiscool/stash)
The fastest, most frictionless way for a developer to save and retrieve valuable knowledge. My most ambitious project so far (2 months of work, solo).

### [Clear Weather](https://github.com/oreiscool/clear_weather)
Clean, minimal weather app with hourly forecast and location-based updates.

### [Simple Notes](https://github.com/oreiscool/simple_notes)
A clean, minimalistic note-taking app built with Flutter.

## Currently

Learning more Flutter, one widget at a time.
