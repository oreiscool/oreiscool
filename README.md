# Hey, I'm Ore 👋

I'm a student getting started with software development, focused on building mobile apps with Flutter.

## What I'm Into

Mobile app development is my thing. I work with **Dart** and **Flutter**, and I've been getting hands-on with tools like Riverpod, Drift (SQLite), and Firebase.

## Projects I've Built

**[Stash](https://github.com/oreiscool/stash)** - The fastest, most frictionless way for a developer to save and retrieve valuable knowledge. My most ambitious project so far (2 months of work, solo).

**[Clear Weather](https://github.com/oreiscool/clear-weather)** - A weather app. Does what it says on the tin.

**[Simple Notes](https://github.com/oreiscool/simple-notes)** - A straightforward note-taking app.

## Currently

Learning more Flutter, one widget at a time.
